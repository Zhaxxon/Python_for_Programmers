# Problem Statement #
# Implement the width() and height() methods which return, respectively, the width and height of a rectangle.
# The tests that follow will create two objectsâ€”instances of Rectangle to test the calculations.

# My solution
class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, x1, y1, x2, y2):  # class constructor
        if x1 < x2 and y1 > y2:
            self.x1 = x1  # class variable
            self.y1 = y1  # class variable
            self.x2 = x2  # class variable
            self.y2 = y2  # class variable
        else:
            print("Incorrect coordinates of the rectangle!")
